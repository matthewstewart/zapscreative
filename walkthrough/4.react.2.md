# React Configuration Part 2
In this section we will develop our React applications User Interface (UI) from plain text page routes to React Components styled with Bootstrap and Material Design Icons. 

## Start Application
If the project is not already running, from the terminal and inside the project directory run:
```bash
npm start 
```

## Switch From CSS to SCSS
Why do that?  
- It allows for cleaner code and 'nesting' of our CSS.
- It allows for use of reusable variables for style templating.
- It's easy to do at the beginning of a project.

### Install Node-Sass
The module `node-sass` is installed in the terminal with:
```bash
npm i node-sass --save-dev
```

### Rename CSS Files & Imports
Rename `./src/index.css` to `./src/index.scss`.  
Rename `./src/App.css` to `./src/App.scss`.  
Change the `import './index.css';` in `./src/index.js` to `import './index.scss';`.  
Change the `import './App.css';` in `./src/App.js` to `import './App.scss';`.  
Done.  Make sure you create `.scss` files rather than `.css` files and utitlize your SCSS.
